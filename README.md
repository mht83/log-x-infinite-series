# Log X Infinite Series

This repository contains a C# program that approximates the natural logarithm (ln) of a number using an infinite series expansion.

## Description

The program calculates the value of ln(x) for a given x (0 < x â‰¤ 2) by summing the series:

$$
\ln(x) = (x - 1) - \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(x - 1)^3 - \ldots
$$

The user can specify the number of terms to include in the calculation for a more accurate approximation.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
